## Windows VM

1. wmic

```
PS C:\Users\Administrator> wmic
wmic:root\cli>CPU Get NumberOfCores,NumberOfLogicalProcessors /Format:List

NumberOfCores=2
NumberOfLogicalProcessors=2

NumberOfCores=2
NumberOfLogicalProcessors=2

wmic:root\cli>
```

### Understanding the Output:

>NumberOfCores=2
NumberOfLogicalProcessors=2

>NumberOfCores=2
NumberOfLogicalProcessors=2

This output shows two sets of results.  This is important. It indicates that your system has two separate CPUs (or CPU sockets). It's not showing hyper-threading.

NumberOfCores: This directly tells you the number of physical cores in each CPU. In your case, each CPU has 2 physical cores.
NumberOfLogicalProcessors: This tells you the number of logical processors (or virtual cores) in each CPU. Here, it's also 2.
Calculating Physical and Virtual Cores:

Since NumberOfCores and NumberOfLogicalProcessors are the same for each CPU, this means:

>Physical Cores (Total): 2 (cores per CPU) * 2 (CPUs) = 4 physical cores

>Virtual Cores (Total): 2 (logical processors per CPU) * 2 (CPUs) = 4 virtual cores

### Key Points:

>No Hyper-threading: Because the number of cores and logical processors is the same for each CPU, hyper-threading is not enabled. If hyper-threading were enabled, you would see NumberOfLogicalProcessors be double the NumberOfCores. For example, if each CPU had 2 cores and hyper-threading was on, you'd see NumberOfCores=2 and NumberOfLogicalProcessors=4 for each CPU.
Multiple CPUs/Sockets: Your output clearly shows that you have two physical CPUs (or sockets) in your system. This is why you see two sets of results.
VMware (Likely): If this is a virtual machine (VM), the number of physical cores you see (4 in this case) represents the number of physical cores allocated to your VM. The host machine that the VM runs on likely has more physical cores. The VM only sees what it's given.
Other Ways to Check (GUI):

### You can also check this information in the Windows GUI:

> Task Manager: Open Task Manager (Ctrl+Shift+Esc). Go to the "Performance" tab and select "CPU." It will show you the number of cores and logical processors. However, it might not explicitly show the number of physical CPUs/sockets.
System Information: Search for "System Information" in the Windows search bar. In the System Information window, look for "Processor." This will give you a description of your processor(s), which may include information about the number of cores. However, like Task Manager, it might not explicitly show separate CPU sockets.
The wmic command you used is the most direct and reliable way to get this information programmatically in Windows.  The GUI methods are useful for a quick visual check.
